    git clone https://github.com/oomaroww/blogify.git
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

## Optimization and Performance
The project includes a demonstration of optimization principles:
-   **Lazy Image Loading:** The `loading="lazy"` attribute is used for all images outside the viewport.
-   **Clean and Readable Code:** The code is well-structured, modularized, and includes detailed comments.
-   **CDN Integration:** Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and jQuery libraries are loaded via CDN for faster resource loading.
